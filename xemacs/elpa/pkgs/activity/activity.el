;;; Commentary:

;; This package meant to log, analyze and report all emacs activity of
;; user which could further utilized to visualize activity of user
;; during period of time or editing session.

;; Enable Activity for the current buffer by invokingi
;; `activity-mode'. If you wish to activate it globally, use
;; `global-activity-mode'.

;; Set variable `activity-api-key' to your API key. Point
;; `activity-cli-path' to the absolute path of the CLI script
;; (activity-cli.py).

;; See http://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/04/07/ for help
;; add example code directly here for quick reference.
